        <h3>Highways</h3>
        Moreover, construction and maintenance of roads can generate huge employment opportunities as it is twice as
        labour intensive as agriculture or housing. Indian roads carry 85 per cent of the passengers and 70 per cent of
        the freight traffic of the country. The highways, make up only 2 per cent of the road network by length, but
        carry 40 per cent of this traffic.National Highways are considered as main arterial routes as it connects big
        cities, industrial centres, major ports and different states of the country.</p>

        <h3>Dams</h3>
        A dam is a structure that is built on rivers, streams, or estuaries for conserving water. It
        directly helps to supply people with adequate water for consumption, industrial and irrigation purposes.
        Broadly, modern dams can be classified into 2 typesâ€“ concrete dams and embankments. Concrete dams or masonry
        dams block streams that run through narrow gorges, whereas embankments control streams and rivers which flow
        through broad valleys.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Bridges</h3>
        A bridge is a structure designed to provide continuous passage over something. Bridges usually
        carry trains, cars, water, or power lines. There are about eight kinds of bridges, beam, cantilever, arch,
        truss, suspension, cable-stayed, movable, and floating bridges.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Towers</h3>
        Architecture has so many different parts that make it very interesting to learn about and to look at. There have
        been many tall buildings around the world and they are so magnificent that people take notice of them and try to
        immolate them. There is something very interesting about looking at the different types of buildings all over
        the world and the different techniques that the different architects used create their masterpieces. One of my
        fondest memories as a kid were going to St. Louis, MO and going up in the Arch to look at the world below.
