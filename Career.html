        <h3>Civil Engineer</h3>
        Civil engineering is the oldest of the main branches of engineering. Civil engineers use their knowledge to
        supervise and plan construction projects such as roads, airports, bridges, canals, tunnels, and wastewater
        systems. They also collaborate with architects to design and construct various types of buildings..</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Architect</h3>
        An architect plans, designs, and oversees the construction of buildings. To practice architecture means
        providing services in connection with the design and construction of buildings and the space within the site
        surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Project Controller</h3>
        Project controls are the data gathering, management, and analytical processes used to predict, understand and
        constructively influence the time and cost outcomes of a project or program; through the communication of
        information in formats that assist effective management and decision making.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Surveyor</h3>
        A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth,
        and they are often used to establish land maps and boundaries for ownership, locations like building corners or
        the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law such as
        property sales.

        Surveyors work with elements of geometry, trigonometry, regression analysis, physics, engineering, metrology,
        programming languages, and the law. They use equipment like total stations, robotic stations, GPS receivers,
        retro-reflectors, 3D scanners, radios, handheld tablets, digital levels, drones, GIS, and surveying software.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Commercial Manager</h3>
        Commercial management is the non-technical business discipline within a company or organization, particularly
        the administration of revenue and expenses to generate a financial return. Its origins appear to go back to the
        defense and construction industries in the United Kingdom in the 1590s.

        Commercial management within an organization is applied only at policy levels. Commercial policies relate to the
        rules or practices that define how a business will be conducted and the standard terms under which external
        relationships will be conducted.
