		<h2>What we construct</h2>
		<h4>Highways</h4>
		Moreover, construction and maintenance of roads can generate huge employment opportunities as it is twice as
		labour intensive as agriculture or housing. Indian roads carry 85 per cent of the passengers and 70 per cent of
		the freight traffic of the country. The highways, make up only 2 per cent of the road network by length, but
		carry 40 per cent of this traffic.National Highways are considered as main arterial routes as it connects big
		cities, industrial centres, major ports and different states of the country.


		<h4>Appartments</h4>The reasons why most people prefer to live in an apartment compared to a house.
		Firstly, most of the newly built societies provide facilities such as a gym, swimming pool and in-built sports
		stadiums for indoor games. An individual may not afford such luxuries in separate abodes. Secondly, if we
		consider safety, many residential apartments provide access inside the main building with an access card, which
		is only issued to the families staying in an apartment. Also, all residents can watch out for any unidentified
		person or bad, making apartments safer.

		<h4>Dams</h4> A dam is a structure that is built on rivers, streams, or estuaries for conserving water. It
		directly helps to supply people with adequate water for consumption, industrial and irrigation purposes.
		Broadly, modern dams can be classified into 2 types– concrete dams and embankments. Concrete dams or masonry
		dams block streams that run through narrow gorges, whereas embankments control streams and rivers which flow
		through broad valleys.


		An example of a masonry Dam in India is Nagarjuna Sagar Dam located in Andhra Pradesh. An example of an
		Embankment Dam in India is the Tehri Dam, located in Uttarakhand. A large section of India’s population suffers
		from a water crisis or mismanagement of water resources.


		<h4>Bridges</h4> A bridge is a structure designed to provide continuous passage over something. Bridges usually
		carry trains, cars, water, or power lines. There are about eight kinds of bridges, beam, cantilever, arch,
		truss, suspension, cable-stayed, movable, and floating bridges.

		<h2>Our Social Works</h2>
		Social work is a profession which promotes social change, problem solving in human relationships and enhance
		well-being. It is important to acknowledge the history of social work and the purpose of social work and why it
		exists. Social work is a questioned theory with different perspectives on what it is and how it should be
		practised. Social work helps people to deal with personal and social problems so that people can overcome or
		adjust to any personal difficulties. Social work is a combination of social stability and social change. Social
		stability promotes individual and social welfare and social change seek to change negative aspects of society.
		Values are implicit within the law and policy and these tend to reflect the values within society. Personal
		values can influence the way social workers interpret and implement their profession.

		<h4>Free Colony for Poor People</h4>

		In the last 15 years We gave home to more than 10000 poor and homeless people.
		And our aim is to give a free colony to each state of India.
		And wee will achieve this very soon.

	<div id="d155">
		<h4>Feed Poor People</h4>

		We should all provide food for the poor. So many families die every day of starvation while we waste our food.
		Everyone needs food, otherwise how are we meant to survive? If we don’t have food to keep us moving and staying
		healthy it’s not possible to work and make a living for ourselves and our families. Everyone should have the
		right to live a healthy life especially when there are tonnes of food being wasted every year. Thousands of
		people are dying because of hunger. People become less productive and able to work without food, we need to help
		them out. No one deserves to go through the pain of starvation, that’s why we should all provide food for the
		poor.There are so many reasons why we should provide food for the poor. There are so many families dying of
		starvation and it is not right. Food is important as we need the right amount of nutrition in our bodies to
		survive. Food also helps people become more productive and have more energy. All that wasting food does is waste
		lives. Everyone should give a helping hand out to the people in need.
